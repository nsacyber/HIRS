<h2>Attestation Certificate Authority (ACA) and TPM Provisioning with Trusted Computing-based Supply Chain Validation </h2>

The Host Integrity at Runtime and Start-up Attestation Certificate Authority is a Proof of Concept - Prototype intended to spur interest and adoption of the [Trusted Platform Module (TPM)](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/work-groups/trusted-platform-module/). It's intended for testing and development purposes only and is not intended for production. The ACA's functionality supports the provisioning of [TPM 2.0](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2019_TCG_TPM2_BriefOverview_DR02web.pdf) with an [Attestation Certificate (AIC)](https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/IWG-Credential_Profiles_V1_R1_14.pdf). The ACA can be configured to perform an Acceptance Test which enforces the Validation of Endorsement and Platform Certificates as well as Reference Integrity Manifests (RIM)s. This serves to illustrate a Supply Chain validation capability.

## Features
The HIRS ACA is a web based server which processes Attestation Identity Requests.
The ACA provides a “provisioner” application to be installed on all devices which will be requesting Attestation Certificates.

## Installation Instructions

For detailed instructions, see [Installation notes](https://github.com/nsacyber/HIRS/wiki/installation_notes).

Packages used for installation can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/nsacyber/HIRS/releases). 
 
### Installing the HIRS ACA
There are several options for installing the HIRS ACA:

An ACA Docker image is automatically created for each release. To run the ACA container using docker:

For more information see the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/nsacyber/HIRS/wiki/Gettingstarted)

## Development History

Version 1.1 added support for the [Platform Certificate v1.1 Specification](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tcg-platform-certificate-profile/). This allows entities that are part of the supply chain (System integrators and Value Added Resellers) the ability to create Delta Platform Certificate to compliment the Base Platform Certificate created by the Platform Manufacturer. See the [Article on Base and Delta Platform Certificates](https://github.com/nsacyber/HIRS/wiki/Base-and-Delta-Platform-Certificates) for details.

Version 2.0 added support for the [PC Client Reference Integrity Manifest (RIM) Specification](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tcg-pc-client-reference-integrity-manifest-specification/) to provide firmware validation capability to the HIRS ACA. This requires that the manufacturer of a device provide a digitally signed RIM "Bundle" for each device. The HIRS ACA has a new page for uploading and viewing RIM Bundles and a policy setting for requiring Firmware validation.

Version 3.0 was completely refactored to build and run on multiple platforms. The Base OS used for development of the ACA was migrated to Rocky Linux with updates to current dependencies (e.g. Java, Tomcat, Mariadb, etc.) and development tools (e.g. Gradle). New features introduced in Version 3.0 include support for the PC Client RIM 1.1 specification including composite RIMs, time-stamps, and counter signatures and detailed linkages between TCG Event Logs, OEM issuer certificates, and Reference Integrity Manifests (RIMs) have been added to provide greater granularity of information. Support for TPM 1.2 (HIRS_Provisioner) and the Cplus version of the TPM provsioner (HIRS_ProvisionerTPM2) was dropped from Version 3.0 and replaced with the [HIRS_Provisioner.NET](https://github.com/nsacyber/HIRS/tree/master/HIRS_Provisioner.NET).

To support the TCG RIM concept a new [tools folder](https://github.com/nsacyber/HIRS/tree/master/tools) has been added to the HIRS project which contains a [tcg_rim_tool command line application](https://github.com/nsacyber/HIRS/tree/master/tools/tcg_rim_tool). The tcg_rim_tool can be used to create NISTIR 8060 compatible SWID tags that adhere to the TCG PC Client RIM specification. It also supports the ability to digitally sign the Base RIM file as the HIRS ACA will require a valid signature in order to upload any RIM file. See the [tgc_rim_tool READ.md](https://github.com/nsacyber/HIRS/blob/master/tools/tcg_rim_tool/README.md) for more details.
